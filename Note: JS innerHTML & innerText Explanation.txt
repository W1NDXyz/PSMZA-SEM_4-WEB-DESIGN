innerHTML and innerText are both used to manipulate the content of an HTML element, but they behave differently.

  1. innerHTML
    Used to set or get the HTML content inside an element.

    Parses and renders any HTML tags inside the content.

    🔹 Example:
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<b>Hello World!</b>";
        </script>
    🔹 Output:
      👉 Hello World! (in bold because <b> is rendered as HTML)

  2. innerText
    Used to set or get the plain text inside an element.

    Ignores and does not render any HTML tags, treating them as plain text.

    🔹 Example:
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
          document.getElementById("demo").innerText = "<b>Hello World!</b>";
        </script>
    🔹 Output:
      👉 <b>Hello World!</b> (Displayed as normal text, no bold effect)

Key Differences:
Feature	                              innerHTML                                                   	innerText
Accepts HTML?                        	✅ Yes                                                        ❌ No
Renders HTML?	                        ✅ Yes	                                                       ❌ No
Safer?	                              ❌ No (Risk of XSS if handling user input)        	           ✅ Yes
Use Case	                            When you need to insert HTML content dynamically	             When you only need to insert plain text


When to Use Which?
Use innerHTML when you need to insert or manipulate HTML content, like adding <b>bold</b>, <p>paragraph</p>, etc.
Use innerText when you only need to display text safely without executing any HTML.


In Your Two Codes:

In the first code (sumNumber function):
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sum: " + calculateSum(num1, num2);
innerHTML is used here because it's simply inserting plain text inside a <p> tag. It works fine, but using innerText would be safer.

In the second code (validateForm function):
document.getElementById("error-message").innerText = "Email cannot be empty!";
innerText is used because we only need to display a plain error message, and using innerHTML isn't necessary.



Conclusion:
Use innerHTML only when necessary (e.g., when inserting formatted content).
Prefer innerText for security and performance when dealing with plain text.
